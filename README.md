Welcome to Video Game Reviewer

Description: 
This app is built for users to be able to add games to the website and allow individuals to comment on those games.
Also allows users to be able to view their previous comments.

How to install:
This application is very simple to install, all you need to do is locate the repo on my github, and clone it down.
Then run ``bundle install`` and ``rails db:migrate db:seed``

How to use:
The most organic flow of this application is to either create a new profile when on the home page, or if you have already done that, just simply log in to begin using. From there you will be able to browse the games already on the page, add new games, comment on those games, or view all ofyour comments.
